# Shell commands can be quickly executed by wrapping them in $() and calling `exec`.
# By default, this will fork and call the command in the shell that is running the script.
$(echo "Hello").exec()

# You can also specify which shell will run the command by passing a path to the shell executable.
# This is inspired by the #! syntax.
$(cat file.txt).using("/bin/zsh").exec()

# Shell commands do not need to be immediately executed, they can be stored and executed later.
let curl_cmd = $(curl https://google.com)
curl_cmd.exec()

# The result of the execution is returned to the script as a CmdResp type. 
let resp = $(curl https://google.com).exec()
print(resp.std_out) # Prints the bytes from standard out
print(resp.std_err) # Prints the bytes from standard err
print(resp.exit_code) # Prints the exit code
